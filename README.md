# Music Releases , Week 4 project by Carl Ã–berg and Fabio Cassisa

We created a responsive React app to showcase music albums with interactive hover effects. The app displays album covers, names, and artists, each with links to external URLs. We followed the provided design, using modular components and data sourced from a JSON file.

### The Problem

We started by planning our component structure in React and it was pretty straightforward. We chose a folder structure where we separate the jsx files from the css, we might choose a different structure for the next project. The playlist was a pretty tough nut to crack, but it was a great learning curve on using components and general knowledge of React and CSS.

After this, we tried to challenge ourselves by making filters, adding new info to each album, and a sidebar to show the playlist. We succeeded to implement everything but we had many difficulties with the amount of CSS to have in order to get the responsiveness we needed. Still now the final UI (for the buttons and the playlist button) is still yet to be improved.
