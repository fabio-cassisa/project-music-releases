# Music Releases , Week 4 project by Carl Ã–berg and Fabio Cassisa

We created a responsive React app to showcase music albums with interactive hover effects. The app displays album covers, names, and artists, each with links to external URLs. We followed the provided design, using modular components and data sourced from a JSON file.

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We started by planning our component structure in React and it was pretty straightforward. We choosed a folder structure where we separate the jsx files from the css, we might choose a different structure for the next project. The playlist was a pretty tough nut to crack, but it was a great learning curve on using components and general knowledge of React and CSS.

### View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
